This C++ program implements the QuickSort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The user is first prompted to input the size of the array. They can then choose to either manually input the array elements or have the program generate random numbers for the array.

The core of the program is the QuickSort algorithm, which uses a pivot-based partitioning method to sort the array. The program also measures and displays the time it takes to perform the sorting in nanoseconds.

Additionally, after each sorting step, the current state of the array is printed (which can be removed for efficiency testing), and the user is asked to press Enter to continue. After the array is sorted, the user has the option to run the program again with a different array.
